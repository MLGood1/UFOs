# UFO’s 

## Overview of Project

Dana, a data journalist, is writing an article about UFO sightings. She wants to display her data as a dynamic table on a webpage.  For a more in-depth analysis, Dana would like to allow users to filter the table for multiple criteria at the same time.

### Results

1.	The new webpage is filterable by user input for five list elements: date, city, state, country, and shape.

2.	 The user can filter the data by inputting a search criterion, using the example provided in the input box.  They can filter by only one criterion, like date.

3.	 The user can also search by multiple criteria like shape and country.

4.	Once the user is done with the filtered data, they can click the UFO Sighting button at the top of the page to clear all filters and load back in the original data table.

### Summary

## Drawback:

One drawback of this webpage is that the user input fields are case sensitive.  The user must input the search criteria exactly like the example in the input box.  They also cannot misspell the search parameter, or the table will not filter.

## Recommendations for further development:
•	Create a filter for duration
•	Add the .tolowerCase()function to the code, to combat the case sensitivity issue.
